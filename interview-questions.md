Your answer: The importance of primary keys is is to identify the uniqueness of a row, where as unique key is to prevent the duplicates, following are the main difference between primary key and unique key. For example, When looking inside a postgresql database of country names, the data can appear in numbered order with the country names alongside its individual primary key number. This is useful because it the primary key can ensure that a table record name can always be uniquely identified.

Researched answer: Relational databases maintain data in tables, providing an efficient, intuitive, and flexible way to store and access structured information. Tables, also known as relations, consist of columns containing one or more data categories, and rows, also known as table records, containing a set of data defined by the category. Applications access data by specifying queries, which use operations such as project to identify attributes and join to combine relations.
